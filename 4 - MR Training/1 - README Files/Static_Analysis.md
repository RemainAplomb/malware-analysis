# Static Analysis of Malware and Files

Static analysis is a crucial step in understanding and assessing the potential risks associated with files, including software and documents. This guide will introduce you to the basics of static analysis, provide practical examples, and point you to valuable resources for further learning.

## What is Static Analysis?

Static analysis involves examining a file without executing it. This method is commonly used in cybersecurity and malware analysis to identify suspicious or malicious characteristics in a file.

## Why Perform Static Analysis?

- **Malware Detection**: To identify and mitigate malicious software.
- **Risk Assessment**: To evaluate the safety of downloading or executing a file.
- **Understanding File Structures**: To examine the internal structure of files.

## Tools for Static Analysis

There are various tools available for static analysis, depending on the type of file you are examining:

- **PE Files (Windows Executables)**
  - [PE Explorer](https://www.heaventools.com/overview.htm)
  - [PEiD](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/PEiD)
  - [Exeinfo PE](http://www.exeinfo.xn.pl/)
- **PDF Files**

  - [PDFid](https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/)
  - [pdf-parser](https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite)

- **Office Documents**
  - [Oletools](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools)

## Static Analysis Steps

1. **File Identification**:

   - Determine the file type and format.

2. **File Metadata**:

   - Extract metadata like author, creation date, etc.

3. **Header Analysis**:

   - Analyze the file's header for anomalies or known malicious patterns.

4. **String Analysis**:

   - Look for suspicious or obfuscated strings within the file.

5. **Resource Examination**:

   - Check embedded resources for anomalies.

6. **Checksum and Hashing**:

   - Calculate checksums or hashes for integrity verification.

7. **Script and Macro Analysis**:

   - Examine scripts and macros within the file.

8. **Code Disassembly**:
   - For executables, disassemble and analyze the code.

## Examples

### Example 1: Analyzing a Windows Executable (PE File)

1. **File Identification**:

   - Use a PE analysis tool to confirm it's a Windows executable.

2. **Metadata**:

   - Extract metadata like the file's version, author, and company.

3. **Header Analysis**:

   - Check for unusual sections or imports.

4. **String Analysis**:

   - Look for suspicious URLs or API calls.

5. **Checksum and Hashing**:

   - Calculate MD5, SHA1, or SHA256 hash.

6. **Code Disassembly**:
   - Disassemble and analyze the binary code using a tool like IDA Pro.

### Example 2: Analyzing a PDF Document

1. **File Identification**:

   - Use PDFid to confirm it's a PDF document.

2. **Metadata**:

   - Extract author, creation date, etc.

3. **String Analysis**:

   - Look for JavaScript or embedded URLs.

4. **Checksum and Hashing**:

   - Calculate SHA256 hash.

5. **Script Analysis**:
   - Analyze JavaScript for malicious behavior.
