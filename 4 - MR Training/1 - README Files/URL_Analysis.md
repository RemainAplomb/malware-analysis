# URL Analysis

## Overview

URL (Uniform Resource Locator) analysis is the process of inspecting and understanding the components of a web address to assess its safety, credibility, and potential risks. Analyzing URLs is crucial for identifying phishing attempts, malicious websites, and other security threats. In this guide, we will explore various tools, techniques, and indicators to help newbies perform URL analysis effectively.

## Tools for URL Analysis

### Online URL Scanners

Several online tools can scan URLs and provide information about potential threats. Some popular ones include:

VirusTotal
URLVoid
ScanURL

### Browser Extensions

Browser extensions like "Web of Trust" (WOT) or "URLScan.io" can provide real-time ratings and reputation data for URLs you encounter while browsing.

### Online Decoding Tools

Tools like CyberChef can decode encoded URLs, making it easier to analyze their true content.

### Command-Line Tools

Advanced users can utilize tools like "curl" and "wget" to fetch URLs and examine server responses directly.

## URL Components

Before diving into the analysis, let's understand the different components of a URL:

Protocol: The communication protocol used to access the resource (e.g., http, https, ftp).

Domain/Hostname: The web server's address hosting the resource.

Port: The port number used for communication (usually omitted for standard ports like 80 for http and 443 for https).

Path: The location of the resource on the server.

Query Parameters: Additional data passed to the server (usually in key-value pairs) to modify the request.

Fragment Identifier: An anchor within the resource to jump to (often used in web pages).

## Analyzing URLs - What to Look For

### Protocol

Always check the protocol. URLs starting with "https://" are encrypted, providing a secure connection, while "http://" lacks encryption and is less secure.

Example: https://www.example.com is safer than http://www.example.com.

### Domain Name

Misspellings: Phishing URLs may use misspelled domain names to trick users. For instance: examp1e.com instead of example.com.
Subdomains: Be cautious with unfamiliar subdomains (e.g., login.example.com vs. example.com).

### Path and Query Parameters

Suspicious Paths: Look for uncommon or unexpected paths. Legitimate websites often have logical paths like "/blog" or "/contact-us".

Query Parameters: Ensure query parameters are relevant and expected. Phishing URLs may contain unexpected parameters.

### Fragment Identifier

Fragment identifiers are used to navigate within a page, but they should not affect the server-side request. Malicious URLs might manipulate fragments to deceive users.

## Examples

### Phishing URL

URL: hxxp://securepaypal[.]com[.]example[.]com/login[.]php?user=myaccount

Analysis:

Protocol: http (less secure).
Domain: example.com (not PayPal's official domain).
Subdomain: securepaypal.com (looks suspicious).
Path: /login.php (common path, but combined with other indicators, it raises suspicion).
Query Parameter: user=myaccount (shouldn't contain sensitive information).
Conclusion: High likelihood of phishing.

### Safe URL

URL: hxxps://www[.]amazon[.]com/dp/B07D5VH89R

Analysis:

Protocol: https (secure).
Domain: amazon.com (official domain).
Path: /dp/B07D5VH89R (logical path for a product page).
Conclusion: Safe URL, likely the product page on Amazon.

## Additional Tools for URL Analysis

Apart from the tools mentioned earlier, here are some more URL analysis tools that can be useful for identifying phishing attempts, malware, and suspicious websites:

1. PhishTank
   PhishTank is a community-driven website where users can submit, verify, and track phishing URLs. It provides a database of known phishing URLs and allows users to check if a URL is flagged as a phishing site.
