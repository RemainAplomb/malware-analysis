# Email Analysis

## Overview

This README provides a detailed guide on how to analyze emails for security and threat intelligence purposes. It covers different aspects of email analysis, including headers, attachments, URLs, and content. The goal is to assist security analysts and researchers in identifying and investigating potential threats, spam, or malicious content in emails.

Email analysis is a crucial part of modern threat detection and incident response. Cybercriminals often use emails as a vector to deliver malware, initiate phishing campaigns, or launch other social engineering attacks. Analyzing emails can provide valuable insights into potential security breaches and help in protecting networks and users from various threats.

This document will cover essential aspects of email analysis, including examining email headers, analyzing attachments, investigating URLs, and performing content analysis.

## Email Headers

Email headers contain metadata and routing information about the email, including sender, recipient, subject, date, and various tracking details. Analyzing email headers can reveal valuable information about the email's origin and the path it took to reach its destination.

## Received Path

One of the critical sections to examine in the email headers is the "Received" path. It shows the sequence of mail servers that processed the email. Each "Received" entry provides information about the server's name or IP address, timestamp, and sometimes additional details like software versions.

Example of a Received path in an email header:

```
Received: from mail.example.com (mail.example.com [192.168.1.100]) by mx.example.net
(Postfix) with ESMTP id 1234567890AB for <recipient@example.net>; Thu, 1 Jan 2023
15:30:45 +0000 (UTC)
```

When analyzing the Received path, consider the following:

Timestamps: Check the timestamps to identify any unusual delays or anomalies in the email's delivery path.

IP Addresses: Look for IP addresses that are not typical for the sender's domain. This could indicate email spoofing or potential malicious activity.

Suspicious Hostnames: Analyze hostnames for any misspellings or discrepancies. Cybercriminals may use similar-looking domain names to deceive recipients.

## X-Originating-IP

The "X-Originating-IP" header provides the originating IP address of the email sender. This can be useful for detecting email spoofing, as it reveals the true source of the email.

Example of an X-Originating-IP header:

```
X-Originating-IP: [192.168.1.200]
```

## Message-ID

The "Message-ID" header contains a unique identifier for the email. It can be used to track the email's path through different servers and systems.

Example of a Message-ID header:

```
Message-ID: <1234567890@example.com>
```

## Attachments

Attachments in emails can be potential carriers of malware or other malicious content. Analyzing email attachments is crucial for identifying threats and protecting users from potential harm.

## Identifying Suspicious Attachments

When examining email attachments, consider the following indicators of suspicious content:

File Type: Be cautious of executable files, scripts, or document formats that can execute macros.

File Extensions: Cybercriminals may use deceptive file extensions to disguise malware. For example, "file.txt.exe" may appear as a harmless text file but is an executable.

Unsolicited Attachments: Be wary of unsolicited emails with unexpected attachments, especially from unknown sources.

Password-Protected Files: Password-protected attachments may hide malicious content. Exercise caution when opening such files.

## URL Analysis

When analyzing URLs, use the following techniques:

URL Scanning Services: Utilize online URL scanning services that can check the reputation of the website for potential threats.

URL Structure: Examine the URL structure for any irregularities or suspicious patterns.

Domain Reputation: Check the domain's reputation using threat intelligence sources.

SSL Certificates: Verify if the website uses a valid SSL certificate. Phishing sites may use self-signed or expired certificates.

## Content Analysis

Content analysis involves examining the email's body and subject to identify potential phishing attempts or malicious payloads.

## Identifying Phishing Attempts

Look for the following indicators of phishing attempts:

Urgency: Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency to prompt immediate action.

Spoofed Domains: Check for misspelled or deceptive domain names to trick recipients.

Request for Sensitive Information: Phishing emails may request personal information, passwords, or financial details.

## Detecting Malicious Payloads

Be cautious of the following indicators of malicious payloads:

Embedded Links: Malicious emails may contain hidden links that lead to malware downloads.

Suspicious Attachments: Emails with unsolicited or unexpected attachments may carry malware.

Malformed Content: Look for strange characters or obfuscated code that may indicate malicious intent.

## Tools

The following tools can aid in email analysis:

### Email Analysis Tools

MIMETool: A command-line tool for analyzing MIME-encoded email messages.

Outlook Message Extractor: Extracts email messages from Outlook data files.

Email Header Analyzer: Analyzes and decodes email headers to reveal hidden information.

### URL Analysis Tools

### Example Email Analysis

Below is an example of how an email analysis report might look:

```
Subject: Urgent: Verify Your Account

From: noreply@example.com

Received Path:

- Received: from mail.example.com (mail.example.com [192.168.1.100]) by mx.example.net
  (Postfix) with ESMTP id 1234567890AB for <recipient@example.net>; Thu, 1 Jan 2023
  15:30:45 +0000 (UTC)

X-Originating-IP: [192.168.1.200]

Message-ID: <1234567890@example.com>

Attachments:

- File: "Invoice_123456.docx"
  Type: Microsoft Word Document (application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document)
  SHA256: 1234567890abcdef...

Content Analysis:

- Phishing Attempt: Urgent request to verify account credentials. Spoofed sender domain (example.com).

- Potentially Malicious Attachment: "Invoice_123456.docx". File type associated with macros.

- Suspicious URL: "https://example.com/verify?id=123456". Domain reputation is unknown.
