    ; Here we use the INC instruction to increment the value of ax by 1

    ; Now ax should contain 11 (10 + 1)

    ; Store the incremented value back in 'var1'

    ; Here we use the DEC instruction to decrement the value of bx by 1

    ; Now bx should contain 19 (20 - 1)

    ; Store the decremented value back in 'var2'
    mov var2, bx
