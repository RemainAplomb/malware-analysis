# Computer Architecture

## Overview

This README provides an introduction to the field of computer architecture. It provides a high-level overview of the fundamental concepts in this field, including an understanding of how computers work at a hardware level, different types of architecture, instruction set architectures, and microarchitecture.

Computer architecture is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create a computer that meets functional, performance and cost goals. This field is often divided into three main subfields: Instruction Set Architecture, Microarchitecture, and Systems Design.

In the world of computer science and engineering, understanding computer architecture is fundamental. It forms the bridge between the hardware of a computer and its software, and thus is of central importance to many different aspects of computing, from designing computers to writing efficient software.

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer that performs most processing inside the computer. The CPU is composed of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logical operations and Control Unit (CU) that extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them, calling on the ALU when necessary.

## Memory Hierarchy

Computer memory is structured in a hierarchy, from faster, smaller, and costlier memory (like caches) near the top to slower, larger, and cheaper memory (like secondary storage) at the bottom. Key types of memory include:

- Register: This is the smallest, fastest, and most expensive type of memory in a computer.
- Cache: This is a smaller, faster memory component that stores copies of information from frequently used main memory locations.
- Main Memory (RAM): This is where a computer keeps data that it is actively using.
- Secondary Memory: This includes magnetic disks, optical disks, and flash memory, which are slower and cheaper than main memory but are non-volatile, meaning they retain information even when power is lost.

## Instruction Set Architecture

Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is the part of the computer architecture related to programming, including the native data types, instructions, registers, addressing modes, memory architecture, interrupt and exception handling, and external I/O. There are different types of ISA, including CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) and RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing), each with its own advantages and challenges.

## Microarchitecture

Microarchitecture, also known as computer organization, is the way a given ISA is implemented in particular processor design. Key aspects of microarchitecture include pipelining, superscalar execution, branch prediction, out-of-order execution, and multicore processors.

## Parallel Systems

With the rise of big data and machine learning applications, parallel computing, where many calculations are carried out simultaneously, has become increasingly important. Key aspects include multiprocessing, multithreading, and the use of graphics processing units for computing.

## Bus

The bus is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. A bus has multiple pathways or 'lines' each for address, data, and control.

There are three types of buses:

- Data Bus: This transfers actual data between components.
- Address Bus: This transfers information about where the data should go.
- Control Bus: This transfers control signals which coordinate all the computerâ€™s activities.

## Input/Output (I/O) Systems

Input/Output refers to the communication between an information processing system (such as a computer), and the outside world, possibly a human, or another information processing system. Inputs are the signals or data received by the system, and outputs are the signals or data sent from it.

## Clock and Timing

The clock keeps the operations of the computer synchronized. The speed of a computer's clock is often used as a measure of system performance.

## Registers

Registers are small amounts of storage available as part of a CPU or other digital processor. Some registers are general purpose and others are used for specific purposes such as keeping track of the next instruction to be executed (program counter), or an important constant such as zero.

## Logic Gates and Circuits

Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions that are fundamental to digital circuits. The basic logic gates are AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.

These additional components along with the ones mentioned before provide a complete understanding of the internal structure and operation of a computer.

Remember, computer architecture involves a detailed understanding of both the hardware and software in a computer system, how these components interact to achieve a desired output, and how they can be structured to optimize this output.

## Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (MUX/DEMUX)

Multiplexers and demultiplexers are combinational circuit components that share information over a single common line to multiple outputs (MUX) or from multiple inputs to a single output (DEMUX). These are used within a CPU to manage data flow and optimize the use of system resources.

## Logic Units (ALU, FPU)

Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): The ALU is a digital circuit within the processor that performs arithmetic and logical operations. It takes the data from the registers, performs the specified operation, and moves the result back to the registers.

Floating Point Unit (FPU): The FPU, or math coprocessor, specializes in handling complex mathematical operations, particularly floating-point operations, more efficiently than the general-purpose ALU.

## Control Unit (CU)

The control unit is the component of the CPU that governs the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, ALU, and input and output devices how to respond to instructions that have been sent to the processor.

## Cache

The cache is a smaller, faster memory which stores copies of data from frequently used main memory locations. There are several levels of cache memory in the system, designed to reduce the time it takes to access memory locations that are used frequently. This includes L1, L2, and sometimes L3 caches, with L1 being the smallest, fastest and closest to the ALU.

## Interrupts and Exception Handling

An interrupt is a signal sent to the processor that interrupts the ongoing processes and helps in smooth execution of processes. Exception handling refers to the response of processors to exceptional conditions, and includes both interrupts and signals resulting from illegal instructions or data conditions.

Understanding these components and how they interact within a computer system is integral to understanding computer architecture. By gaining this knowledge, you can better understand how to optimize the performance of these systems and create more efficient software and hardware designs.
