# Addressing Modes

## Overview

Addressing modes in assembly language define the methods used to access data or operands during program execution. Understanding addressing modes is crucial in malware analysis to interpret memory access patterns, identify data structures, and analyze code execution flow. By familiarizing yourself with these addressing modes, you can effectively analyze and understand the behavior of malicious code.

## Direct Addressing Mode

In direct addressing mode, the operand is specified by a direct memory address. The instruction directly refers to the memory location where the data is stored.

Example usage:

```
mov eax, [0x12345678] ; Move the contents of memory location 0x12345678 into EAX
```

## Register Addressing Mode

In register addressing mode, the operand is stored in a register. The instruction operates directly on the register's contents.

Example usage:

```
add eax, ebx ; Add the value in EBX to the value in EAX
```

## Immediate Addressing Mode

In immediate addressing mode, the operand value is directly specified within the instruction itself. The value is not fetched from memory or a register.

Example usage:

```
mov eax, 42 ; Move the immediate value 42 into EAX
```

## Indirect Addressing Mode

In indirect addressing mode, the instruction uses a memory address stored in a register to access the operand.

Example usage:

```
mov eax, [ebx] ; Move the contents of memory location pointed by EBX into EAX
```

## Base Addressing Mode

In base addressing mode, the instruction uses a memory address calculated by adding a displacement value to a base register.

Example usage:

```
mov eax, [ebx + 0x10] ; Move the contents of memory location EBX+0x10 into EAX
```

## Indexed Addressing Mode

In indexed addressing mode, the instruction uses a memory address calculated by adding an index value to a base register.

Example usage:

```
mov eax, [ebx + ecx] ; Move the contents of memory location EBX+ECX into EAX
```
