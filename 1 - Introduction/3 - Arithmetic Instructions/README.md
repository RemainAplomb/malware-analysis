# Arithmetic Instructions

## Overview

Arithmetic instructions are fundamental operations in assembly language that perform mathematical computations on data. In malware analysis, understanding how arithmetic instructions work is crucial for analyzing malware behavior, reverse engineering algorithms, and identifying potential vulnerabilities.

Arithmetic instructions are essential in malware analysis for understanding how malware performs calculations, manipulates data, and modifies registers. By familiarizing yourself with these instructions and their usage, you can better analyze and interpret the behavior of malware samples.

## ADD (ADDITION)

The ADD instruction performs addition between two operands and stores the result in the destination operand. It can be used to add numerical values, memory contents, or registers.

Example usage:

```
; Adds the value in EAX with the value in EBX and stores the result in EAX
add eax, ebx
```

## SUB (SUBTRACTION)

The SUB instruction subtracts the second operand from the first operand and stores the result in the destination operand. It can be used to subtract numerical values, memory contents, or registers.

Example usage:

```
; Subtracts the value in EAX with the value in ECX and stores the result in EAX
sub eax, ecx
```

## MUL (MULTIPLICATION)

The MUL instruction performs unsigned multiplication between the multiplicand and the value in the specified register. The result is stored in a register or a combination of registers.

Example usage:

```
; Multiplies the value in EAX with the value in ECX and stores the 64-bit result in EDX:EAX
mul ecx
```

## DIV (DIVISION)

The DIV instruction performs unsigned division between the dividend and the specified register. The quotient is stored in the destination register, and the remainder is stored in another register.

Example usage:

```
; Divides the value in EAX by the value in EBX, stores the quotient in EAX, and the remainder in EDX
div ebx
```

## INC (INCREMENT)

The INC instruction increments the value of the specified operand by 1. It can be used to increment registers or memory locations.

Example usage:

```
; Increments the value in EAX by 1
inc eax
```

## DEC (DECREMENT)

The DEC instruction decrements the value of the specified operand by 1. It can be used to decrement registers or memory locations.

Example usage:

```
; Decrements the value in EAX by 1
dec eax
```

## AND (BITWISE AND)

The AND instruction performs a bitwise logical AND operation between the operands and stores the result in the destination operand. It can be used to perform logical operations on binary values or to mask certain bits.

Example usage:

```
; Performs a bitwise AND between the value in EAX and the value in EBX, and stores the result in EAX
and eax, ebx
```

## OR (BITWISE OR)

The OR instruction performs a bitwise logical OR operation between the operands and stores the result in the destination operand. It can be used to perform logical operations on binary values or to set certain bits.

Example usage:

```
; Performs a bitwise OR between the value in EAX and the value in EBX, and stores the result in EAX
or eax, ebx
```

## XOR (BITWISE XOR)

The XOR instruction performs a bitwise logical XOR operation between the operands and stores the result in the destination operand. It can be used to perform logical operations on binary values or to toggle specific bits.

Example usage:

```
; Performs a bitwise XOR between the value in EAX and the value in EBX, and stores the result in EAX
xor eax, ebx
```
