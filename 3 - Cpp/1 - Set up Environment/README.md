# C++ Setup with Visual Studio Code

This guide will help you set up your environment for C++ development using Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

1. **Visual Studio Code**: If it is not installed on your computer, download and install it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

2. **C++ Compiler**: If you are on a Windows machine, MinGW is recommended. You can download the installer from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).

## Steps

1. **Install the C/C++ extension for VS Code**

   Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window. Then search for `c++`. Click Install on the C/C++ extension provided by Microsoft.

2. **Configure the Compiler Path**

   Add MinGW to your system path. Here's how to do that:

   - Right-click on Computer and click on `Properties`.
   - Click on `Advanced system settings`.
   - Click on `Environment Variables`.
   - Under `System Variables`, find `Path` and click on it.
   - Click on `New` then add the MinGW directory (`C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin`).
   - Click on `OK` to save.

3. **Hello World in C++**

   Create a new file called `hello.cpp`, and type in the following code:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   int main() {
       std::cout << "Hello, World!";
       return 0;
   }
   ```
